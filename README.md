Single-Player Tic-Tac-Toe

This code stemmed from a 2-Player Tic-Tac-Toe game we made for learning Python in-class (c. 2018), leading to some functions
and code-writing quality being redundant and/or sloppy so apologies for my near-first attempt at writing long-form code.

The program itself runs with no percievable delay for up to 10x10 sized board.
